How big is it? Roughly Thrumbo sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predatory carnivore. 
Where does it live? The Earthen Depths.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Weaker leather, very little of it. Very hard to kill, high HP regen rate. Acid damage melee attacks. Able to engulf prey?
ONLY spawns via an event. Like a thrumbo event, but highly HIGHLY hostile and dangerous.
