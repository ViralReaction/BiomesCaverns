How big is it? A little bigger than a muffalo.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Omnivore.
Where does it live? All Caverns biomes, reasonably rare in most. Most common in Crystal Caverns.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Heavy/strong chitin. Gives rock chunks based on its rock type and crystal resource when butchered.

Peaceful unless attacked. Should NOT be preyed upon. Very dangerous when angered.
