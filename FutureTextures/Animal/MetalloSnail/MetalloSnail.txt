How big is it? Roughly dog sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Omnivore, will eat anything. Not a predator.
Where does it live? The Earthen Depths 
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Strong chitin. Can be sheared for either metal scrap or small amounts of steel. Maybe about as often as a muffalo gives wool?
