How big is it? Same size as other bat.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predatory carnivore of small animals.
Where does it live? Surface caverns. 
Does it spawn in packs? Yes.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Texture should be unaffected by light level. They should attack just fine in darkness.
