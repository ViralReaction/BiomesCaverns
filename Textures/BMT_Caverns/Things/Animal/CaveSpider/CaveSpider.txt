How big is it? A little bigger than a muffalo.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predatory carnivore.
Where does it live? Fungal Forest. Very rare.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Heavy/strong chitin. Very fast for its size. Injects prey with a paralytic venom (new hediff maybe) that rapidly reduces consciousness and movement in prey. 

WILL EVENTUALLY WRAP UP KILLED PREY TO PRESERVE THEM. (gotta get the art and unique code)
