How big is it? Almost dog sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Crystal Caverns.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, medium sized.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Weak but very pretty chitin. Flies around fairly fast. Not very strong.

Caterpillar should have a high hunger rate! 

Moth should have a high nuzzle rate OR give a mood buff for being so pretty when nearby.
