How big is it? Roughly dog sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? The Earthen Depths 
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Weak leather, but gives a unique leather that has really high heat resistance/fire proofing. Creature itself should be 100% immune to fire damage and catching on fire.
